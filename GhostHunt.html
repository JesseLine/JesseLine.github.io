							<p>Ghost Hunt is a single player endless wave survival game where the player has to fight off increasingly difficult waves of ghosts while managing their flashlight's battery level. This was a solo rapid-prototyping project which was done in a two week time period.</p>
							<p>I used Unity and C# to develop this game and used Jira and Github for version control and progress tracking. The goal of this project was to gain experience with prototyping a project in a short amount of time. I had to quickly decide on an idea, and create a game for the first week, where it was then part of a playtest where I could get feedback from my peers on my game. This was vital to my game's final result and I was able to make some design pivots to quickly fix the biggest problems in the remaining week.</p>
